# 2020-Shopee-Competition
This repository consists of the works I've done in the 2020 Shopee Competition. Specifically speaking, competition 1 and competition 5.
For Competition 1, the goal was to identify order brushing sellers.
For Competition 5, the goal was to identify whether there were delayed logistics based on analyzing logistic records.
